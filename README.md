# Credit Card Checker  

This is a JavaScript project that uses a Luhn Algorithm to verify credit card numbers.  
It uses mock credit card numbers that test as either valid or invalid based on the algorithm.  
    NOTE: just because the credit card tests as valid doesn't mean it's someone's actual credit card.  
The original program tests a group of cards at once and logs the results in the console.  
    That program was renamed to consoleCCC.js and runs in node.  
A front-end webpage was added that tests one card number at a time. Those files have typical names.
