# Credit Card Checker  

This is a JavaScript project that uses a Luhn Algorithm to verify credit card numbers.  
It uses mock credit card numbers that test as either valid or invalid based on the algorithm.  
NOTE: just because the credit card tests as valid doesn't mean it's someone's actual credit card.
